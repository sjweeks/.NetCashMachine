** Project Profile ** 

Using C#

- This is a simple project created from the beginning of learning C#. It is a cash machine, it gives the user the ability to log in to the cash machine using the Pin.

- From there the user can choose from the following options - 
  - Check balance
  - Withdraw funds
  - Deposit funds
  - Change pin
  - Exit

** Areas of improvement ** 
This project is fairly simple, however I will look to improve it by ensuring the balance is specificed and changed throughout all of the functions as opposed to just changing it after one action. 
Also further to this, it could be changed so there are different users who use the cash machine. 

** How to initialize ** 
- Download - https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
- If using VS Code, download the C# extensions 

** How to use Cash Machine **
- Enter pin (currently set in stone however this will change)
- If pin incorrect then it will loop around until the correct pin is entered
- If pin is correct, the options will be presented
- Choose the relevant option
- Check balance - Shows the user the current balance, then gives the option to either return to options or quit
- Withdraw funds - Asks the user to input desired withdrawl amount, then the balance is shown (minus the withdrawl), it will then ask if there is anything else.
- Deposit funds - Asks the user to input desired withdrawl amount, then the balance is shown (minus the withdrawl), it will then ask if there is anything else.
- Change Pin - Asks the user to re-enter the pin number, (if incorrect it will loop again), then the user is prompted to ask for the new pin number, once entered they will be asked if they are sure about making the change - If Yes or No the user will be informed of the option, they will then be redirected back to the options
